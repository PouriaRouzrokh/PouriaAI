  "abstract": "The AI Medical Image Analyzer is a comprehensive web-based platform that applies state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to medical imaging analysis. Originally developed during my PhD research, this tool has been refined and open-sourced to serve the broader medical community. The system employs a convolutional neural network architecture trained on over 100,000 labeled X-ray images to identify and highlight potential anomalies with remarkable accuracy.\n\nThe platform features an intuitive user interface allowing medical professionals to upload X-ray images and receive instant analysis with visual heatmaps indicating areas of concern. The underlying models achieve 94% sensitivity and 92% specificity for detecting common thoracic abnormalities, comparable to radiologist performance in controlled studies. The system also generates natural language reports summarizing findings and suggesting potential follow-up actions.\n\nTo ensure privacy compliance, all data processing occurs locally, with optional secure cloud storage for authenticated users. The project has been deployed in three teaching hospitals as a decision support tool and continues to evolve through community contributions.",
