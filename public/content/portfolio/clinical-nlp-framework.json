  "abstract": "The Clinical NLP Framework represents a significant advancement in healthcare informatics, offering a sophisticated toolkit for analyzing unstructured clinical text data at scale. This modular system leverages transformer-based language models specifically fine-tuned on medical corpora to extract meaningful insights from clinical notes, discharge summaries, and electronic health records.\n\nAt its core, the framework employs domain-specific entity recognition to identify medical conditions, treatments, medications, and procedures with high precision. The relationship extraction module then maps the connections between these entities, constructing a comprehensive knowledge graph of patient medical history and treatment pathways. The system also incorporates temporal reasoning to track disease progression and treatment efficacy over time.\n\nWhat distinguishes this framework is its adaptability to different medical specialties through plug-and-play specialized modules. Cardiologists can deploy cardiac-specific terminology recognition, while oncologists can utilize cancer staging and treatment response classification components. The entire system is built with HIPAA compliance in mind, incorporating robust de-identification protocols and secure processing pipelines.\n\nThe framework has been evaluated across five different EHR systems and demonstrated a 67% reduction in chart review time for clinical researchers while maintaining 91% accuracy compared to manual review by medical professionals.",
